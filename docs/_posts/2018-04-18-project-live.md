Welcome to SpotBlocker!

SpotBlocker, a Spotify ad blocker, is a free, open-source, non-intrusive Spotify ad blocker.
The project is a fork of [EZBlocker](https://www.ericzhang.me/projects/spotify-ad-blocker-ezblocker), and in this first release features a number of new features and interface changes.
